### Cat-Dog Classification using Pytorch

This is a common computer vision project to classifier images whether it is cat or dog. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using Pytorch.

### Data
